# VC1 Project 5

## Description

This is a representation of my apartment created in blender. You can set the time and the month. The position of the sun is calculated and therefore also the lighting conditions. You can also switch all the lights in the apartment on and off.
This project will also be used to create a dashboard at the entrance to the apartment using a touchscreen. It currently has the function of controlling and visualizing the Phillips Hue lighting system. The color and brightness are also currently displayed.

## TechStack

The project was created with React. React-three-fiber was used instead of Three.js. This makes it possible to use Three.js in a React application and with all the advantages of React.
